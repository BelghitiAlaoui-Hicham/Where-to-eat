# Where to EatThis is a simple application that I have used to try my hand at node.js and redis. The idea came from a co-worker who asked me if I could build an application to collect the votes of our other co-workers to determine where to eat. This is the result.## How to useI tried to keep this as simple as I could (in both programming and use). There are four things that you can do; enter an area, log in, search, and vote.* Enter an area. The area is set by the hash in the URL. Enter #test at the end of the URL and you will have entered the test area. Only votes inside of each area are broadcast and tallied. * Log in. No passwords just a name. Enter a name, email, or facebook username into the textbox. Names and emails will use gravatar to create your avatar. Your facebook image is used like so - fb:username. Yes you can impersonate people, so be on your best behavior.* Search. FourSquare is used to find restaurants around you. If the restaurant you want is not found just enter the name and search again. The x button will clear all the searched for restaurants off the map.* Vote. Click the icon on the map and then click vote. The votes will be tallied and hopefully you will come to a decision. The areas and votes expire after two hours. You can vote on a lunch spot and everything is cleared out by supper. This is why I am not too concerned about impersonations as everything has an expiration date.## Technologies usedThis system uses many different open source software projects. * http://nodejs.org/* http://socket.io* http://redis.io/* http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/* http://gravatar.com/* http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/* http://jquery.org/## Demohttp://ejosh.co/demos/wte
